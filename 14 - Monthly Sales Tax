// Monthly Sales Tax
//
// A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales for the month and the amount of sales tax collected. 
//
// Write a program that asks for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash register (i.e. sales plus sales tax). 
// Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent, and the county sales tax is 2 percent.
//
// If the total amount collected is known and the rotal sales tax is 6 percent, the arnount of product sales may be calculated as:
//
//  * S = T / 1.06
//
// S is the product sales and T is the total income (product sales plus sales tax).
//
// The program should display a report similar to:
//
// Month: October
// --------------------
// Total Collected:      $ 26572.89
// Sales:                $ 25068.76
// County Sales Tax:     $   501.38
// State Sales Tax:      $  1002.75
// Total Sales Tax:      $  1504.13
