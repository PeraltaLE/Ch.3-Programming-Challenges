// There are three seating categories at a stadium for a softball game:
// 
//  * Class A seats cost $15
//  * Class B seats cost $12
//  * Class C seats cost $9
//
// Write a program that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold,
// then display the amount of income generated from ticket sales.
//
// Format your dollar amount in fixed-point notation, with two decimal places of precision,
// and be sure the decimal point is always displayed.
