// A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales.
// The remainder goes to the move distributor.
// 
// Write a program that calculates a theater's gross and net box office profit for a night.
// 
// The program should ask for the name of the movie, and how many adult and child tickets were sold. 
// (The price of an adult ticket is $10.00 and a child's ticket is $6.00.)
// 
// It should display a report similar to:
// 
// Movie Name:									"Wheels of Fury"
// Adult Tickets Sold:							               382
// Child Tickets Sold:								       127
// Gross Box Office Profit:							   $ 4,582.00
// Net Box Office Profit:							   $   916.40
// Amount Paid to Distributor:							   $ 3,665.60
// 
// Note: Assume the theater keeps 20 percent of the gross box office profit.
