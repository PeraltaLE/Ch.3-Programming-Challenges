// How Many Widgets?

// Write a program that calculates how many widgets are stacked on a pallet, based on the total weight of the pallet.
// 
// The program should ask the user how much the pallet weighs by itself and with the widgets stacked on it.
// It should then calculate and display the number of widgets stacked on the pallet.
